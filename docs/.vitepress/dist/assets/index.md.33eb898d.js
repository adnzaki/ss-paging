The name was taken from <strong>Smartscore Pagination</strong> which was a part from SSPaging creator past project. SSPaging provides sets of ready-to-use functions and properties to create pagination. SSPaging does not provide any template or view, but you can learn how to create it with the examples provided<br> SSPaging available in two versions: <code>SSPaging</code> for Composition API, and <code>SSPagingStore</code> for use with Pinia. The Vuex version is no longer published since Vuex has been deprecated by the Vue Team. I will provide the Vuex version if you need it, but it has less feature than the Pinia version. Also, the Vuex version will no longer be updated.</p><h2 id="brief-concept" tabindex="-1">Brief Concept <a class="header-anchor" href="#brief-concept" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>SSPaging aims to allow developer to get a full control of pagination. Rather than using a full pagination library with the template included, you can include pagination functionalities on your own template as long as it uses Vue.js. By using this way, you have a full flexibility with pagination without having to breakdown your current template. SSPaging can be used everywhere in your template, without forcing you to use template from pagination library itself.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li><h3 id="powerful" tabindex="-1">Powerful <a class="header-anchor" href="#powerful" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>SSPaging is a powerful server-side pagination library that provides sets of ready-to-use actions/methods to work with the server.

As it is a library that developed for my own projects.</p><ul><li><h3 id="server-side-dependant" tabindex="-1">Server-side dependant <a class="header-anchor" href="#server-side-dependant" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>SSPaging is a server-side pagination, so it will not work without connection to server. So, each feature like searching and sorting data is rely on server connection to work.</p><ul><li><h3 id="usage-scope" tabindex="-1">Usage scope <a class="header-anchor" href="#usage-scope" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>SSPaging only work with Composition API that needs Vue &gt;3.0 or forcing you to use Pinia if you want to use it in Vue 2. For Vue 3 users, SSPaging works well with Composition API and Pinia. Current version of SSPaging also does not support Vuex. Though the Vuex version is still used in my project, but it is just for migration process.</p><ul><li><h3 id="no-template-make-your-own" tabindex="-1">No template, make your own! <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-template-make-your-own" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3></li></ul><p>SSPaging does not provide any template, so you have to build or use your own template.</p><h2 id="url-pattern" tabindex="-1">URL Pattern <a class="header-anchor" href="#url-pattern" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>SSPaging has 2 options for providing URL to get the data. The first option is following SSPaging URL pattern, and the second option is using your own URL pattern.<br> The pattern of URL accepted by SSPaging must looked like this:</p><div class="language-"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">/main-url/{limit}/{offset}/{orderBy}/{searchBy}/{sort}/{search}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>main-url</code> can contain anything you want, but <code>/{limit}/{offset}/{orderBy}/{searchBy}/{sort}/{search}</code> must be in its order. If you need more URL arguments, you can add before <code>/{limit}...</code>.<br> If you would like to use your own URL, you can set it in <code>getData</code> method that will be explained later. <strong>But remember that SSPaging is server-side pagination library, it will only work if you can provide everything from your backend (including URL pattern) that needed by SSPaging to generate pagination.</strong><br> We recommend you to use the URL pattern from SSPaging, so you do not have to think how to match SSPaging needs.</p>`,23),r=[n];function s(l,d,h,u,p,c){return i(),a("div",null,r)}const m=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
