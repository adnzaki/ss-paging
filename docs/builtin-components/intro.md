# Pagination Components Introduction

Pagination components is a higher level library that provides ready-to-use components to work with SSPaging in very simple way. These components offer nearly zero configuration to run pagination and seamlessly integrated with SSPaging core functionality.

## Features
Pagination components offer almost any element that needed by SSPaging except table with the following features:
- <strong>Integrated - </strong>
All SSPaging components are fully integrated, so you do not need to worry about how to handle pagination. 
- <strong>Multiple Instance - </strong>
SSPaging components can have multiple instance since it uses props to connect to your SSPaging instance. It means you can use the same SSPaging components more than one in the same page.
- <strong>Nearly Zero Config - </strong>
Since pagination components have been designed to work as best as possible with SSPaging, they need almost no configuration.

## How-it-works
Pagination components can be used locally via module or globally via `app.component()` option. For use without build tool, you can only use global version of the components.
